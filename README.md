# MATLAB-Fault-Analysis
A MATLAB-based GUI application for simulating and analyzing balanced and unbalanced faults in power transmission lines.

## üìå Features

- Fault Type Analysis:
  - Balanced (3-phase) faults
  - Unbalanced faults:
    - Line-to-Ground (LG)
    - Line-to-Line (LL)
    - Double Line-to-Ground (LLG)
- Interactive GUI with intuitive controls
- Real-time calculations:
  - Fault current magnitude
  - Fault power
- Visualizations:
  - Current magnitude gauge
  - Time-domain waveform plotting
- User-friendly input system for power system parameters

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Key Components
1. Fault Current Calculations:
   ```matlab
   % Balanced fault example
   Z_total = Z_source + Z_line + R_fault;
   I_fault = V_system / Z_total;
Symmetrical Components for unbalanced faults

MATLAB App Designer for GUI implementation

Formulas Implemented
Fault Type	Formula
Balanced	I_f = V / (Z_s + Z_l + R_f)
LG Fault	I_f = 3V / (Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_0 + 3R_f)
LL Fault	I_f = sqrt(3)V / (Z_1 + Z_2 + R_f)
